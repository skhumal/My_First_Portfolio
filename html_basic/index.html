        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>From a young age, I was the family tech guru, always the one everyone called when their devices had issues. Whether it was setting up a new phone or troubleshooting software problems, I found joy in helping others navigate the digital world. This experience ignited my passion for technology and led me to explore software development.

            After taking my first coding class, I discovered the thrill of building my own solutions and applications. I’ve been diving deeper into web development ever since, eager to create tools that make life easier for users.
            
            My goal is to develop intuitive applications that bridge the gap between technology and everyday users. Outside of coding, I enjoy designing casual clothing and using printing and embroidery machines to bring my ideas to life. This creative outlet fuels my passion for innovation and problem-solving.
            
            I’m excited about the path ahead and look forward to collaborating with others who share my enthusiasm for technology and creativity.</p>
